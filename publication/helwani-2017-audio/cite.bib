 abstract = {An audio signal processing device for generating a plurality of output signals for a plurality of loudspeakers from an input audio signal comprises a driving function determining unit adapted to determined driving functions of a plurality of loudspeakers for generating a virtual left binaural signal source and a virtual right binaural signal source based upon a position and a directivity of the virtual left binaural signal source, a position and a directivity of the virtual right binaural signal source and positions of the plurality of loudspeakers. Moreover, it comprises a filtering unit adapted to filter a left binaural signal and a right binaural signal using the driving functions of the plurality of loudspeakers resulting in the plurality of output signals. The left binaural signal and the right binaural signal constitute the input audio signal or are derived there from.},
