 abstract = {The extraction of local tempo and pulse information from audio recordings constitutes a challenging task, in particular for music with significant tempo variations. Furthermore, the existence of various pulse levels such as measure, tactus,  and  tatum  often  makes  the  determination  of  absolute tempo problematic. In this demo, we present the tempogram toolbox, which contains MATLAB implementations for extracting various types of recently proposed tempo and pulse-related audio representations. These representations are particularly designed to reveal useful information even for music  with  weak  note  onset  information  and  changing tempo. The  toolbox is provided  under a GNU-GPL license.},
