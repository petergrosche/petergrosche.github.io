 abstract = {The disclosure is based on the finding that acoustic near-field transfer functions indicating acoustic near-field propagation channels between loudspeakers and ears of a listener can be employed to pre-process audio signals. Therefore, acoustic near-field distortions of the audio signals can be mitigated. The pre-processed audio signals can be presented to the listener using a wearable frame, wherein the wearable frame comprises the loudspeakers for audio presentation. The disclosure can allow for a high quality rendering of audio signals as well as a high listening comfort for the listener. The disclosure can provide the following advantages. By means of a loudspeaker selection as a function of a spatial audio source direction, cues related to the listener's ears can be generated, making the approach more robust with regard to front/back confusion. The approach can further be extended to an arbitrary number of loudspeaker pairs.},
