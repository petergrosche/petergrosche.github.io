 abstract = {An apparatus configured to obtain a plurality of phase differences is provided. Each phase difference represents a difference in phase between a spectral component in a first sound signal and a corresponding spectral component in a second sound signal, to estimate an aliasing frequency. Phase differences in frequency bands above the aliasing frequency are expected to be wrapped, and to unwrap the plurality of phase differences in dependence on the estimated aliasing frequency. A phase difference obtained from spectral components that are comprised in one frequency band is unwrapped independently of any phase difference obtained from spectral components that are comprised in another frequency band.},
