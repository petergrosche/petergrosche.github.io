 abstract = {The general goal of music synchronization is to automatically align the multiple information sources such as audio recordings, MIDI files, or digitized sheet music related to a given musical work. In computing such alignments, one typically has to face a delicate tradeoff between robustness and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce novel audio features that combine the high temporal accuracy of onset features with the robustness of chroma features. We show how previous synchronization methods can be extended to make use of these new features. We report on experiments based on polyphonic Western music demonstrating the improvements of our proposed synchronization framework.},
