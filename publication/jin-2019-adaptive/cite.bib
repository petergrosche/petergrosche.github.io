 abstract = {A signal processor for determining a plurality of drive signals for driving a plurality of loudspeakers to cancel a reverberation effect in a listening area, wherein the signal processor is configured to determine from one or more measured audio signals a plurality of measured physical coefficients in a basis of physical sound functions, such that a sum of the physical sound functions, weighted with the plurality of measured physical coefficients approximates the one or more measured audio signals, wherein at least half of the plurality of measured physical coefficients are zero, determine a residual error between the plurality of measured physical coefficients and a plurality of desired physical coefficients, estimate a transfer function describing a transformation from the plurality of desired physical coefficients to the plurality of measured physical coefficients, based on the determined residual error, and update the plurality of drive signals based on the estimated transfer function.},
