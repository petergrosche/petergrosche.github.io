 abstract = {The individualization of head related transfer functions (HRTFs) can make an important contribution to improving the quality of binaural technology applications. One approach to individualization is to exploit the relationship between the shape of HRTFs and the anthropometric features of the ears, head, and torso of the corresponding listeners. To identify statistically significant relationships between the two sets of variables, a relatively large database is required. For this purpose full-spherical HRTFs of 96 subjects were acoustically measured and numerically simulated. A detailed cross-evaluation showed a good agreement to previous data between repeated measurements and between measured and simulated data. In addition to 96 HRTFs, the database includes high-resolution head-meshes, a list of 25 anthropometric features per subject, and headphone transfer functions for two headphone models.},
