 abstract = {A digital compressor for compressing an input audio signal is presented. The digital compressor comprises a compression gain control for providing a compression gain parameter, and a compression parameter determiner for determining a compression ratio from the compression gain parameter. The compression parameter determiner may be configured to weight the compression gain parameter by a predetermined weight factor to obtain the compression ratio. The digital compressor further comprises an auxiliary signal generator for manipulating the input audio signal in dependence of the compression ratio to obtain a first auxiliary signal, and a combiner unit for combining the first auxiliary signal with the compression gain parameter to obtain a second auxiliary signal, and for combining the input audio signal with the second auxiliary signal to obtain the compressed audio signal.},
