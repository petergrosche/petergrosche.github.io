 abstract = {An input audio signal is separated into input audio signal components (X(k,b)). A set of two or more band branches provides output audio signal components (Y(k,b)). The set of band branches comprises one or more compressor branches Each compressor branch compresses a respective input audio signal component (X(k,b)) into a respective output audio signal component (Y(k,b)). A summed audio signal (y(t)) is generated by summing the output audio signal components (Y(k,b)). A residual audio signal (v(t)) is a difference between the input audio signal and the summed audio signal(y(t)) A virtual bass signal (w(t)) comprises one or more harmonics of the residual audio signal (v(t)). An output audio signal is generated by summing the summed audio signal (y(t)) and the virtual bass signal (w(t)).},
