 abstract = {A sound signal processing apparatus including a plurality of microphones, where each microphone is configured to receive the sound signal from the target source, a processor configured to estimate a first power measure on the basis of the sound signal from the target source received by a first microphone of the microphones and a second power measure on the basis of the sound signal from the target source received by at least a second microphone of the microphones, which is located more distant from the target source than the first microphone, and the processor is further configured to determine a gain factor on the basis of a ratio between the second power measure and the first power measure, and an amplifier configured to apply the gain factor to the sound signal from the target source received by the first microphone.},
